# About The Project
The BabyTracker is the UNT Capstone Project for the group Time Complexity.
BabyTracker is a mobile app designed to help parents take care of their babies.
Nowadays many households have both parents working. With having to juggle a
baby's needs between work, chores, and even other children, it can become hard
to keep track of baby. 

The goal of BabyTracker is:
- Keep track of a baby's schedule.
- Record a baby's health information such as calories, sleep, and diaper changes.
- Be able to easily share this information between parents or other caretakers.

# Features
- Track multiple babies.
- Input events such as naps, meals, diaper changes.
- Sort events by date and display in a chart.
- Assign other users as a baby's caretaker that can also view/edit your baby.
- Keep track of events that occur in the future.
